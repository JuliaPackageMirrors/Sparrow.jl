# Sparrow.jl

This is a package for making plots with ctioga2 () as the backend. The idea is to separate plotting into stages. At the first stage, you setup groups of data that will be added to the plot. Then, you make a frame into which these groups will be laid. Next, you determine in what manner the groups should be plotted (line plot, histogram, etc.). Last, you plot everything!
